# PadelHUB Development Assistant

## Project Overview
You are assisting with PadelHUB, a comprehensive padel management platform built with:
- **Frontend**: Angular 18+ with TypeScript, Angular Material, PWA capabilities
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript, MongoDB, JWT authentication
- **Architecture**: Full-stack TypeScript application with role-based access control

## Good Practices & Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
1. **TypeScript Best Practices**
   - Use strict type checking and avoid `any` types
   - Implement proper interfaces and type definitions
   - Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for classes/interfaces, camelCase for variables/functions
   - Use generic types where appropriate for reusability

2. **Angular Specific Guidelines**
   - Follow Angular style guide and conventions
   - **ALWAYS create separate .html and .scss files** - never use inline templates or styles in TypeScript files
   - Use reactive forms over template-driven forms
   - Implement proper component lifecycle hooks
   - Use OnPush change detection strategy where possible
   - Lazy load feature modules for better performance
   - Use Angular Material components consistently

3. **NestJS Backend Standards**
   - Use dependency injection and decorators properly
   - Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions
   - Use DTOs for data validation and transformation
   - Follow RESTful API design principles
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization guards

### Security Practices
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper JWT token handling
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Validate user permissions on both frontend and backend
   - Secure sensitive routes with guards

2. **Data Protection**
   - Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
   - Implement proper CORS configuration
   - Hash passwords with bcrypt

### Performance Optimization
1. **Frontend Performance**
   - Use OnPush change detection strategy
   - Implement lazy loading for routes and modules
   - Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
   - Use trackBy functions in *ngFor loops
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists

2. **Backend Performance**
   - Use proper database indexing
   - Implement caching strategies where appropriate
   - Use pagination for large data sets
   - Optimize database queries

### Testing Standards
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Write tests for all business logic
   - Use Jest for backend testing
   - Use Jasmine/Karma for Angular testing
   - Aim for >80% code coverage

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test API endpoints thoroughly
   - Test component interactions
   - Mock external dependencies

### Code Organization
1. **File Structure**
   - Follow feature-based folder structure
   - Keep components, services, and models organized
   - Use barrel exports (index.ts) for clean imports
   - Separate shared utilities and components

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use descriptive, meaningful names
   - Follow Angular/NestJS naming conventions
   - Use consistent naming across the application

### Error Handling
1. **Frontend Error Handling**
   - Implement global error handler
   - Show user-friendly error messages
   - Log errors for debugging
   - Handle network errors gracefully

2. **Backend Error Handling**
   - Use custom exception filters
   - Return consistent error responses
   - Log errors with appropriate detail
   - Validate input data properly

### Documentation Standards
1. **Code Documentation**
   - Write clear, concise comments for complex logic
   - Document API endpoints with proper descriptions
   - Use JSDoc for function and class documentation
   - Keep README files updated

2. **API Documentation**
   - Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
   - Document request/response schemas
   - Include example requests and responses

### Version Control Practices
1. **Git Workflow**
   - Use meaningful commit messages
   - Follow conventional commit format
   - Create feature branches for new development
   - Use pull requests for code review

2. **Code Review Guidelines**
   - Review for code quality and standards
   - Check for security vulnerabilities
   - Ensure proper testing coverage
   - Verify documentation updates

## Response Style
- **Always respond in Spanish language**
- **Only generate markdown files and scripts when they are strictly informative or necessary**
- **Always use Git Bash compatible commands when providing terminal instructions**
- **Always execute commands directly using tools instead of just suggesting them**
- Provide clear, actionable guidance
- Include code examples when helpful
- Reference specific files and line numbers when applicable
- Suggest improvements for code quality and performance
- Consider security implications in all recommendations
- Be thorough but concise in explanations

## Focus Areas
- Full-stack TypeScript development
- Angular and NestJS best practices
- MongoDB database optimization
- Role-based access control implementation
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security and authentication patterns
- Testing strategies and implementation
- Code maintainability and scalability
